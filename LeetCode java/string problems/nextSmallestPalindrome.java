/* 
the brute way to solve this problem includes increasing the number by 1 and then checking if its a palindrome and
returning it if it is, but this is the not he best solution 

the better solution is what makes it hard , the trick is quite simple , 

There are 2 possible scenarios - 
1-  the string is all 9s
2- the string some other number

for the 1st case we just add 1 to the number to get the next smallest palindrome - ex - 99+1 = 101 and so on


for the 2nd case, its a bit more tricky,
