/*
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

/*HOW THE CODE WORKS-
you iterate once over the array and store each integer as key and the no of times it appears in array as its value
then you iterate over each value of hashmap to find the kay whose value is greater than half the length of array


space - O(n) - time same

}
// this was my try at this type of solution but this didn't work

// this is the correct and super simple way of doing this question

/* logic used -
the majority element would always be at the index which is exactly in between the array 
after we have sorted the array ex--
let array be 2,1,1,2,2,2,4
after sorting array will be
1,1,2,2,2,2,4

time compl - nlog(n) space compl - O(n)
 */

    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {

    }
}



/* MORE's voting algorithm  */


/* THEORY OF HOW IT WORKS- 
YOU TAKE TWO INTEGERS- CANDIDATE AND VOTE
- YOU TAKE AN ELEMENT AS CANDIDATE AND THEN GIVE IT ONE VOTE IF THE NEXT ELEMENT IS DIFFERENT THEN YOU SUBTRACT ONE VOTE AND IF
IT IS SAME THEN YOU INCREASE BY ONE VOTE  , IF AN ELEMENT GETS 0 VOTES THEN THE NEXT ELEMENT BECOMES CANDIDATE AND GETS ONE VOTE

upar upar se - all are trying to downvote the majority element but it exists so many times that it always wins the election
